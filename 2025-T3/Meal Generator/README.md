# NutriHelp-AI – SIT374 Capstone Team Project (A)

## Project Overview
The team-based capstone project NutriHelp-AI was created as a component of SIT374's Capstone Team Project (A). The project's main goal is to develop an AI-assisted nutrition assistance system that offers context-aware and safety-conscious meal suggestions based on user preferences, dietary requirements, and fundamental health considerations.

This repository provides artifacts demonstrating my individual contribution to the team effort.

## My Role & Contributions
My contribution in this project was on AI logic and rule-based meal recommendation design. I helped build the meal generating logic, structured food data, safety considerations, and related documentation. My work ensured that meal recommendations were consistent, understandable, and in line with project requirements.

## Key Files & Folders

### `meal_generator.py`
Contains the main rule-based logic that generates meal recommendations. This file explains how to use conditional logic, restrictions, and context-aware decision-making in a practical system.

### `meal_library.json`
Stores structured meal data that is used in the recommendation logic. This file explains how to use JSON to organize and manage food-related data in an understandable, reusable way.

### `Documentation & Reports/`
Includes written documentation and reports about system logic, context-aware recommendations, and design explanations. These documents enable understanding, reflection, and handover.

### `Testing & Result/`
Contains testing outputs and result files used to validate the behavior of the meal recommendation logic. This category contains examples of basic system testing, assessment, and verification processes.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (rule-based AI logic)
- JSON (structured meal and rule data)
- Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration)

---

## Notes
This project was created cooperatively as part of a team. Model training, deployment, and dependency management were handled at the system level, whereas my contributions concentrated on AI logic, data structure, documentation, and testing.
