    "This notebook documents the development and evaluation of **Classifier v2**, an experimental food image classifier built during Weeks 3–7 of the project.\n",

    "The purpose of this work was to explore whether a newly trained classifier could outperform the existing production model. This notebook focuses on:\n",
    "- Dataset preparation and augmentation\n",
    "- Training experiments\n",
    "- Evaluation and stress testing\n",
    "- Final decision-making based on results\n"
