This reaction is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the Grignard reagent adds to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde, resulting in the formation of an alcohol after hydrolysis. The product formed will be 1-phenyl-1-penten-3-ol or a similar structure depending on the specific reaction conditions, but for simplicity, let's consider it adds a methyl group and a hydrogen to the carbonyl group, making it C₆H₅CH=CHCH₂OH (assuming the major product is the result of 1,2-addition and then considering the general outcome of such a reaction).\n",

      "2. **Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) to form product 2.**\n",
      "   - PCC is an oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones without over-oxidizing them to carboxylic acids. Assuming product 1 is a primary or secondary alcohol, this step will oxidize it. Given the starting material and the first reaction, let's consider the oxidation of the alcohol to an aldehyde or ketone. The carbon skeleton remains the same as in product 1, so if we started with C₈H₈O (a simplified view of the alcohol formed from cinnamaldehyde after Grignard reaction), we still have C₈H₈O after this step, but now as an aldehyde or ketone.\n",

      "   - This reagent is Corey's sulfone, used in the Julia olefination reaction. It reacts with an aldehyde to form an alkene, extending the carbon chain by one carbon (since one of the carbons from the sulfone is incorporated into the product, and the other becomes part of a byproduct). So, if product 2 has 8 carbons and acts as an aldehyde (which we are assuming for this step based on the previous reactions), the Julia olefination would add one more carbon to the chain, making product 3 have 9 carbons from the starting aldehyde portion plus the phenyl ring's 6 carbons, totaling 15 carbons if we count the original cinnamaldehyde backbone correctly and include the added carbon in the olefination step. However, considering the error in counting the carbon atoms in previous steps and focusing on the reaction with Corey's sulfone, let's reconsider the actual outcome:\n",

      "Given trans-cinnamaldehyde (C₉H₈O) reacts with methylmagnesium bromide, we add one carbon (from CH₃MgBr) to form an intermediate, which then gets oxidized back to an aldehyde or ketone form without changing the carbon count (resulting in a C₁₀ compound).
