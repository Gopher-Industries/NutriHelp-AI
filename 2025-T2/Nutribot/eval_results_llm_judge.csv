Examples of wholegrain and high cereal fiber varieties mentioned include:

- Barley
- Oats
- Rye
- Rice

It is essential to note that if a food contains gluten due to the presence of barley, oats, or rye, the required name of the cereal must be declared, and 'gluten' in the summary statement.

Overall, the key is to focus on wholegrain and high cereal fiber varieties, including rice and other grains like barley, oats, and rye, as a part of a balanced diet.","The recommendation for grain (cereal) foods varies based on the organization providing the guidelines, but I'll provide information based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020 and the Australian Dietary Guidelines 2013. Keep in mind that these recommendations may have slight variations over time.

**Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020:**

- Whole grains should make up at least half of the daily grain intake.
- Whole grains include brown rice, whole-wheat bread, whole-grain pasta, and others that contain the bran, germ, and endosperm.
- Refined grains, which are often enriched but lack fiber and nutrients, should be consumed in moderation.
- Choose a variety of grains to get the benefits of different nutrients.

**Australian Dietary Guidelines 2013:**

- Consume a variety of whole grain foods (e.g., whole wheat, rye, oats, barley, brown rice) instead of, or in addition to, refined grain foods.
- Limit refined grains to no more than 30% of the grains intake.

**General recommendations:**

- Aim for 6-11 servings of grains daily, depending on age and sex.
- Include a variety of grains to ensure a range of nutrients.

Discretionary foods are optional and not essential for providing essential nutrients. However, they are commonly consumed as treats or part of cultural and social practices. Examples of discretionary foods may include:

1. Sweet and savory snacks
2. Baked goods, cakes, and pastries
3. Sugary drinks, such as soft drinks and sweetened tea and coffee
4. Refined and processed meats
5. Fatty and processed meats
6. Foods high in saturated fats, such as fried foods and butter
7. High-sugar desserts and frozen yogurts
8. Foods high in added salt

The Australian Dietary Guidelines aim to encourage Australians to limit their intake of discretionary foods, as excessive consumption can lead to an imbalance in nutrient intakes, contributing to weight gain, obesity, and other diet-related health issues.","In the Australian Dietary Guidelines context, discretionary or 'extra' foods refer to foods and drinks that are high in kilojoules, added sugars, saturated fats, or sodium. These foods are considered discretionary because they are not essential for providing the nutrients that the human body needs to maintain good health, unlike the core foods (or 'core foods groups') that are specified in the guidelines. 

Examples of discretionary foods and drinks include:

- sweets and desserts
- snack foods
- fried foods
- processed meats
- foods that are high in added sugars, like sugary drinks, candies and ice cream
- foods high in added fats and oils, like fried chicken, and pastries.

The Australian Dietary Guidelines suggest limiting the intake of discretionary foods in order to promote a balanced diet and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.",tie,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,"Both candidates accurately describe discretionary foods in the Australian Dietary Guidelines context as foods high in energy, sugar, salt, or saturated fat that are not necessary for nutrients.",rag,base

11,What are the 5 food groups in the Australian Dietary Guidelines?,"health.gov.au - About Food and Nutrition: vegetables/legumes, fruit, grains, lean meats/alternatives, dairy/alternatives","Vegetables & legumes, fruit, grains, lean meats & alternatives, dairy & alternatives","The Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend eating a variety of foods from five distinct food groups. Unfortunately, those 5 groups weren't explicitly stated in the text provided. However, the Australian Dietary Guidelines, published by the National Health and Medical Research Council, generally recommend the following five main food groups:

1. **Grains** (cereals, bread, pasta, rice): These are an essential source of carbohydrates for the body.
2. **Vegetables** (dark green, red, orange, starchy, and legume): They are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that benefit overall health and well-being.
3. **Fruit**: These are a vital source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, with a range of colors providing different benefits.
4. **Dairy and/ or fortified dairy alternatives** (milk, cheese, yogurt): They are a significant source of calcium, vitamins D, and other essential nutrients for strong bones and teeth.
5. **Protein** (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds): They are essential for maintaining and building muscle mass, as well as numerous other functions in the body.

These five food groups are an essential part of a balanced diet, according to Australian Dietary Guidelines.","The Australian Dietary Guidelines categorize foods into 5 groups based on their nutrient content. 

1. **Fruit group**: Focuses on a variety of whole, unprocessed fruits, such as fresh, frozen, canned, and dried.

This is part of their efforts to help Australians make healthier food choices, as advised by the Australian Dietary Guidelines. 

Some possible actions that the Australian government might be taking to achieve this goal include:

1. **Regulating food manufacturers**: The government might be working with food manufacturers to set limits on the amount of salt, fat, and sugar that can be used in processed foods.

2. **Encouraging healthier food options**: The government might be supporting the development of healthier alternatives to popular processed foods and drinks.

3. **Educating consumers**: The government might be launching public awareness campaigns to educating consumers about the importance of limiting their intake of processed foods and sugary drinks.

4. **Collaborating with industry**: The government might be working with food retailers, food manufacturers, and other industry stakeholders to promote healthier food choices.

5. **Monitoring and evaluating progress**: The government might be tracking the progress of their initiatives to reduce salt, fat, and sugar in processed foods and evaluating their effectiveness in improving the health of Australians.

6. **Establishing a sugar, fat and salt tax or charge**: While this hasn't been explicitly implied, it is something that many countries which follow Australia in this type of initiative do.

Overall, the Australian government's actions aim to promote healthier food choices and reduce the negative impact of processed foods on public health.","There have been several initiatives and actions by the Australian government to promote healthier processed foods. Some key actions include:

1. **Front-of-pack nutrition labelling:** In 2021, Australia introduced a front-of-pack nutrition labelling system called the ""Traffic Light Labelling"" system. This system uses red, amber, and green colours to indicate the nutritional content of packaged foods, with red indicating high levels of sugar, sodium, and saturated fats.

2. **Added Nutrient Declaration (AND):** Australia requires manufacturers to declare the amount of added nutrients in their packaged foods. This includes added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats.

3. **Australian Dietary Guidelines:** Health Australia's Dietary Guidelines provide a framework for healthy eating and nutrition, and include recommendations for Australians to make healthier food choices, including limiting processed foods high in sugar, salt, and saturated fats.

4. **Food policy initiatives:** The Australian government has also introduced several food policy initiatives, such as the ""Healthy Food Partnership"" and the ""National Obesity Action Agenda,"" to promote healthier food choices and reduce overweight and obesity rates.

5. **Restrictions on unhealthy food advertising:** Australia has implemented laws regulating the advertising of unhealthy foods to children. 

These actions aim to promote healthier food choices and provide consumers with accurate and transparent nutrition information to make informed decisions about their diet.",rag,2,4,4,5,2,3,4,5,"Candidate B's answer directly relates to the reformulation of processed foods and improved labelling, as mentioned in the GOLD answer and REFERENCE_EXCERPTS.",base,rag
14,What is the status of Australians’ fruit and vegetable intake?,health.gov.au - Food and Nutrition homepage: 'Only 1 in 13 adults eat enough fruit/veg; 94% of children aged 2-17 don’t eat enough veg',Very low intake; e.g. 1 in 13 adults meet guidelines; 94% of children lack veg intake,"Based on the provided context, the status of Australians' fruit and vegetable intake is concerning. Despite health experts' recommendations to include a variety of fruits and vegetables in their diet, and the Australian Government's promotion of at least five serves of vegetables daily, research suggests that Australians are falling short.

The data from the Australian Health Survey indicates that a staggering 95% of Australians do not consume enough vegetables. This suggests a widespread issue with Australians not meeting the recommended daily intake of vegetables.

Additionally, the National Health Survey and other studies have found that Australians of all ages tend to consume too much discretionary food, too much sugar, salt, and saturated fat, which can contribute to a diet that is low in nutrients and high in energy.

It is also worth noting that the National Health Survey, Australian Health Survey, and National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey have been conducted at different times, with the Australian Health Survey covering the years 2011 to 2013. However, the data from the surveys suggests a persistent issue with Australians' fruit and vegetable intake across different age groups and populations.

To address this issue, the Australian government, health experts, and other organizations may need to implement targeted interventions to promote fruit and vegetable consumption, such as education campaigns, tax incentives for healthy food, and initiatives to make healthy food more accessible and affordable.

In terms of specific fruit intake, the data does not provide a clear indication of how Australians perform in meeting the recommended intake of fruits. However, it is likely that Australians face similar challenges with fruit consumption as they do with vegetable consumption.

Overall, the data suggests that Australians could benefit from a concerted effort to promote and support healthy eating habits, particularly when it comes to fruit and vegetable consumption.","According to data from Australia's National Health Survey (2019-2020) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Australians' fruit and vegetable intake remains a concern. 

Here are some key statistics:

1. Less than 1 in 5 Australian adults (22%) eat the recommended 500g of fruits and vegetables per day.
2. Men were less likely to achieve the recommended daily intake of fruit and vegetables, with only 14% of men eating the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables, while 31% of women achieved this target.
3. Children and adolescents aged 2-18 years also had a low intake, with only 10% achieving the recommended daily intake.
4. The data also revealed that older people (75 years and over) were more likely to consume the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables.
5. Some of the groups that had the lowest intake of fruits and vegetables were those with a higher income, and those with a higher level of education.
6. Fruit was more likely to be consumed than vegetables among both children and adults, with 64% of children consuming at least one serve of fruit, but only 53% consuming one serve of vegetables.
7. There was a notable gap between what adults recommended for themselves and what they recommended to their children, highlighting the ongoing education efforts required for parents to encourage better eating habits in their children.

It can be inferred from these statistics that the recommended fruit and vegetable intake in Australians still remains suboptimal, and more efforts are required to increase the intake and improve dietary habits.",base,2,1,4,4,2,1,4,4,"Candidate A provides more relevant statistics, but neither directly matches the REFERENCE_EXCERPTS or GOLD.",base,rag

1. **Frozen produce**: Choose frozen produce with no added salt or sauces. Frozen produce is often picked at its peak ripeness, then frozen quickly to lock in nutrients. It may be more affordable and available year-round.

2. **Canned produce**: Opt for canned produce in water or their own juice, without added salt or sauces. Look for products with low sodium levels. Canned produce is often low in fat and high in essential vitamins and minerals, but check the labels for added ingredients and preservatives.

To keep frozen or canned produce a healthy choice:

- Choose products with minimal added ingredients and no added salt.
- Limit your servings based on your daily calorie needs.
- Check the serving size on the packaging and stick to it.
- Don't over-rely on these options; vary your diet to include a range of whole, unprocessed foods.

1. Sweets: Consuming sweets in moderation may be acceptable, but they should not make up a significant portion of one's diet due to their high sugar content and potential negative health impact.

2. Refined cereals: In comparison to wholegrain or high-fibre varieties, refined cereals offer fewer nutrients and more empty calories, making them less desirable.

3. Processed meats: Processed meats, like sausages, bacon, and ham, should be consumed in limited amounts due to their high salt and preservative content.

4. Full-fat dairy and high-fat foods: Full-fat dairy products and high-fat foods, such as butter and oils, should be consumed sparingly due to their high calorie content and potential health risks.

5. Baked goods and processed snacks: Foods like cakes, pastries, biscuits, and other processed snacks are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, making them an occasional treat rather than a staple in a healthy diet.

6. Beverages with high added sugar: Consuming beverages with high added sugar, such as sugary drinks and sweetened teas and coffees, should be avoided or significantly limited due to the excessive sugar intake.

It's essential to maintain a balanced diet by consuming a variety of different foods from all food groups, with an emphasis on whole, nutrient-dense foods, as mentioned in the provided context.","Here are some foods that should form only a very small part of a healthy diet or are best consumed in moderation:

1. **Processed Meats**: These include hot dogs, sausages, bacon, and deli meats. They're high in saturated fat, sodium, and preservatives, increasing the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.

2. **Refined Sugars**: Foods high in added sugars, such as candy, baked goods, and sweetened beverages, are best consumed in small amounts. Limiting sugary foods can help prevent chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

3. **High-Sodium Foods**: Excessive sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Limit foods high in sodium, such as restaurant meals, canned goods, and processed snacks.

4. **Fried Foods**: Fried foods, such as french fries and fried chicken, are high in calories, fat, and sodium. They contribute to weight gain, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease.

5. **High-Fat Dairy Products**: While some dairy products are essential for overall health, high-fat dairy products like whole milk, cheese, and cream should be consumed in moderation. They're high in saturated fat and calories, which can contribute to weight gain and increased risk of heart disease.

6. **Sugary Drinks**: Beverages like soda, sports drinks, and sweet tea or coffee are high in added sugars and calories. Drinking these regularly can lead to weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and dental cavities.

7. **High-Sugar Snacks**: Snacks like chips, crackers, and candy are high in added sugars and unhealthy fats. They contribute to weight gain and increased risk of chronic diseases.

8. **High-Tyramine Foods**: Tyramine is an amino acid found in fermented foods like cheese, wine, and chocolate. High intake of tyramine can cause headaches, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular problems.

9. **Caffeinated Beverages**: Excessive caffeine consumption can lead to jitteriness, anxiety, insomnia, and an increased heart rate. Limit your daily intake of caffeine to 200-300 milligrams.

10. **Raw or Undercooked Eggs, Meat, and Fish**: Consuming undercooked or raw eggs, meat, and fish can lead to foodborne illnesses like salmonella, E. coli, and parasites.

11. **High-Fat Snack Bars**: Many energy bars, granola bars, and snack bars contain high amounts of sugar, fat, and calories. Limit your intake to minimize health risks.

12. **High-Sodium Condiments and Sauces**: Condiments like soy sauce, oyster sauce, and teriyaki sauce are high in sodium and should be used sparingly.",rag,2,1,4,4,1,1,4,4,"Candidate A is more accurate as it includes baked goods and beverages with high added sugar, aligning with the provided context.

31,Why are nutritional needs especially important for older people in aged care (what changes happen)?,"health.gov.au - Older people: need higher levels of some critical nutrients … changes to taste, smell, appetite … which can affect their food intake","Critical nutrients (protein, calcium) need increase; changes in taste, smell, appetite affect intake","The recurring message is clear - nutrition plays a vital role in the health and well-being of older individuals in aged care. As people age, their nutritional needs undergo significant changes due to various physiological and biochemical modifications. Here are some key reasons why nutritional needs are especially important for older people in aged care:

1. **Reduced muscle mass and strength**: Muscle mass and strength decrease with age, making it more challenging for older individuals to digest and absorb nutrients. Adequate nutrition is essential to maintain muscle mass and function.
2. **Altered metabolism**: Older adults often experience changes in their metabolic rate, which can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, or inadequate nutrient intake. A balanced diet helps maintain energy levels and supports overall health.
3. **Impaired taste and smell**: Age-related changes in the sense of taste and smell can make food less appealing, leading to decreased food intake and malnutrition. A varied and flavorful diet can help overcome these challenges.
4. **Gastrointestinal changes**: Older individuals may experience digestive issues, such as constipation, diarrhea, or gastroparesis, which can affect nutrient absorption. A tailored diet and nutritional plan can help manage these conditions.
5. **Increased risk of chronic diseases**: Older adults are more likely to develop chronic conditions, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, which require specific nutritional interventions to manage.
6. **Medication effects**: Certain medications can interfere with nutrient absorption or increase the risk of malnutrition. A coordinated approach between healthcare providers and nutritionists can help mitigate these effects.
7. **Decreased water intake**: Older individuals may experience polyuria (excessive urine production), which can lead to dehydration. Adequate hydration is essential for maintaining nutrient balance and overall health.
8. **Social and emotional factors**: Older adults in aged care often face social isolation, loneliness, and depression, which can affect their appetite and food intake. Nutritious meals and social interaction can help alleviate these issues.

In aged care settings, providing tailored nutritional support is crucial to address these changes and promote optimal health and well-being among older individuals. A well-planned diet, accompanied by regular monitoring and adjustments as needed, can help mitigate the risks associated with aging and support a dignified and healthy life.

To find out more about food and nutrition in aged care, consult with healthcare professionals, registered dietitians, or aged care organizations for guidance and resources on creating personalized nutrition plans for older adults.","As people age, their nutritional needs change due to various factors, making it essential for older individuals in aged care to prioritize their nutritional intake. Some key changes that occur in older adults include:

1. **Loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia)**: As we age, our muscle mass, strength, and function decline. This can make everyday activities more challenging, increasing the risk of falls and other health complications. Adequate protein intake is essential to maintain muscle mass and strength.
2. **Reduced digestive efficiency**: Older adults may experience reduced stomach acid production, slower digestion, and impaired nutrient absorption, making it harder for the body to utilize nutrients.
3. **Increased risk of malnutrition**: Older adults are more prone to malnutrition due to decreased appetite, difficulty swallowing, dental issues, and social isolation, which can lead to inadequate nutrient intake.
4. **Chronic disease management**: Older adults often have multiple chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension, which can be influenced by nutrition. For example, a balanced diet can help manage blood sugar levels or blood pressure.
5. **Changes in taste and smell**: Age-related loss of taste and smell can decrease appetite, leading to inadequate nutrition.
6. **Medication interactions**: Certain medications can interact with food or cause appetite suppression, increasing the risk of malnutrition.
7. **Decreased mobility**: Older adults with mobility issues may not be able to access or prepare meals, leading to inadequate nutrition.
8. **Hormonal changes**: Age-related hormonal changes, such as decreased insulin levels, can lead to weight loss, muscle wasting, and bone loss.
9. **Nutrient deficiencies**: Older adults are at increased risk of vitamin B12, iron, and other nutrient deficiencies due to reduced absorption and inadequate intake.

To address these changes, nutritional needs for older adults in aged care include:

1. **Higher protein intake** (1.0-1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight) to maintain muscle mass and strength.
2. **Increased calorie intake** (30-50% above the recommended dietary allowance) to support energy needs.
3. **Hydration management** (adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration).
4. **Frequent and small meals** to manage appetite and prevent weight loss.
5. **Nutrient-dense foods**, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
6. **Avoidance of restrictive diets** and instead focus on eating a balanced and varied diet.
7. **Considerations for chronic disease management**, such as dietary advice for diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension.
8. **Supplements**, as needed, such as vitamin B12 or iron, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

These requirements come from relevant laws and regulations, such as the Aged Care Quality Standards in Australia, and may vary depending on the jurisdiction.

Here are some key standards related to the dining experience:

1. **Aged Care Quality Standard 1: Consumer dignity and choice respected**: This standard emphasizes the importance of respecting individual residents' choice, dignity, and cultural diversity when it comes to their dining experience.
2. **Aged Care Quality Standard 2: Ongoing assessment and planning with consumers**: Providers must continue to assess residents' dietary needs and preferences and incorporate these into their meal planning and service.
3. **Aged Care Quality Standard 3: Person-centred practice**: This standard requires providers to deliver care that is tailored to individual residents' needs, values, and preferences, including their dining experience.
4. **Aged Care Quality Standard 5: Feedback and continuous improvement**: Providers must engage with residents and their families to gather feedback on the dining experience and use this information to make improvements.

In terms of specific requirements, some of the key elements include:

* **Nutrition and hydration**: Providers must ensure that residents receive nutritious meals that meet their dietary needs and preferences.
* **Cultural and social preferences**: Providers must respect residents' cultural and social preferences when it comes to meal times and dining arrangements.
* **Menu variety and choice**: Providers must offer a range of menu options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences.
* **Food presentation and taste**: Providers must ensure that meals are presented in a way that is appealing to residents and meets their dietary needs.
* **Meal times and frequency**: Providers must accommodate residents' individual needs and preferences when it comes to meal times and frequency.

Overall, the regulation and compliance requirements for the dining experience in aged care emphasize the importance of delivering person-centred care that prioritizes residents' individual needs, preferences, and dignity.","Under regulation and compliance in the Australian aged care sector, the dining experience standard is governed by the Aged Care Quality Standards (ACQS).

However, I can guide you on how to approach this issue.

If you had access to the actual data, you could calculate the average daily spend per resident using both on-site and bought-in main meals. This requires knowing the total number of residents and their total expenditure on meals during Q1 2021.

In an ideal scenario, you might have data like this:

- Total number of residents in Q1 2021: N
- Total expenditure on meals purchased from on-site and bought-in sources in Q1 2021: $M

The average daily spend per resident would then be the total expenditure on meals in the quarter divided by the total number of residents in the quarter, multiplied by 90 (representing the days in Q1 for 2021):

One such method is the use of 'sensory-friendly' dining areas and personalized meal planning.

Residences can incorporate 'sensory-friendly' designs into dining areas, such as:

- Dimmable lighting 
- Calming colors
- Non-cluttered tables
- Familiar music

Personalized meal planning is another effective method, as each resident's meal options can be tailored to their nutritional needs, dietary restrictions, and personal preferences.

However, considering the initial text, a more relevant point is not the environment or menu but the provision of care that is essential to this group and their meals. Some care homes may also utilize a system of familiar or comfortable objects, like family photos or heirlooms, to ease residents with dementia into mealtime.

The key takeaway is that each aged care home can take a unique approach to meet the different needs of their residents and enhance the dining experience, particularly for those with dementia.","One method used by aged care homes to improve dining experiences for residents with dementia is using a 'cafeteria-style' or 'restaurant-style' dining approach with smaller eating areas or quiet rooms to reduce noise levels and create a more intimate atmosphere.

This method can help cater to the sensory and social needs of residents with dementia, who may become anxious or overwhelmed in large, noisy dining environments. By providing smaller, more manageable spaces, residents can feel safer and more relaxed, leading to a more enjoyable dining experience.

In addition, a 'restaurant-style' approach can also include elements such as:

- Choosing favourite foods or familiar dishes
- Providing a range of dining options to cater to different tastes
- Using gentle, calm music to create a soothing atmosphere
- Encouraging social interaction and conversation with other residents and staff
- Involving residents in the meal planning and preparation process, as much as possible.

By adapting the dining environment to the needs of residents with dementia, aged care homes can help create a more positive and enjoyable experience for this vulnerable group.",base,0,0,4,3,0,0,5,5,"Neither answer matches the REFERENCE_EXCERPTS or GOLD, but A is slightly more relevant.",base,rag
39,What do the food standards require for front‑of‑pack health or nutrition claims on packaged food?,"health.gov.au - Companies can make nutrition or health claims, but must meet criteria …",Front‑of‑pack claims allowed but must meet required criteria; always check full label,"Unfortunately it cannot be confirmed what the food standards require for front‑of‑pack health or nutrition claims on packaged food, due to the limitations of the provided context and data. However, it does provide some information about the general labelling and information requirements. 

In Australia and New Zealand, there is the Food Standards Code which dictates regulations on the labeling of packaged foods. However, to get the most up-to-date information,  a discussion with your  food enforcement authority is recommended.","In the EU, where the food standards apply, front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition and health claims have specific requirements. For pre-packed products, FOP nutrition declarations are a mandatory requirement to display on the packaging. This was set by the Nutri-Score system, and other FOP labels are voluntary. But some specific rules exist.

To give clear, accurate, and easy-to-understand information for consumers, the European food standards, and labeling directives are as follows:

1. **Specificity:** Front-of-pack nutrition claims should be clear, easy to understand, and not misleading. 
2. **Nutri-Score:** As of now, a majority of the EU countries have adopted a color-coded Nutri-Score system for labeling the nutritional quality of prepacked food. This system uses an ""A"" (green) and ""E"" (red) color codes.
3. **List of Authorized Claims**: A non-exhaustive list of authorized claims in the EU includes: 
    - Low fat 
    - Sugar-free 
    - Gluten-free 
    - Low-calorie 
    - Vegan
4. **General Requirements For Nutrition Content Claims:** Claims must be substantiated by scientific evidence. 
    - The claim should not imply any health benefits if no direct link with public health is provided (example: the claim ""rich in vitamin D"" is allowed, but ""may prevent disease"" is not).
    - Claims must not exaggerate the nutritional value of the food product.
    - The nutrition claim is required to be followed with the actual nutrient values on which the claim was made in the nutrition table per 100g/100ml.
5. **Health Claims:** The claims made to suggest a specific health benefit can only be used for food products with specific ingredients and a scientific justification for the health claim.
    - Health claims should be scientifically proven by evidence and based on the European Food Safety Authority's opinions.
    - Health claims can't be misleading or suggest benefits not supported by the evidence.

40,What should a shopper know about Health Star Ratings in comparing foods?,health.gov.au - HSR system scores ½ to 5 stars … compare similar packaged foods,HSR gives ½ to 5 stars to compare nutritional profiles,"If a shopper wants to compare foods using Health Star Ratings, here are some key points to consider:

1. **The more stars, the healthier the choice**: A food with 5 stars is generally considered healthier than one with 4 stars, and so on. This provides a quick and easy way to compare similar foods.
2. **Health Star Ratings are voluntary**: While many packaged foods have Health Star Ratings, not all of them do. Always look for the rating on the packaging to make an informed choice.
3. **More than 10,000 products have health stars**: This means that many popular packaged foods have been rated, so you can use this system to compare a wide range of products.
4. **The system uses a nutrient profiling scoring calculator**: This calculator helps to assess the nutritional value of a food product, taking into account factors like saturated fat, sugar, and sodium.
5. **Use the rating to make quick comparisons**: The Health Star Rating system is designed to help you quickly compare similar foods. If you're looking for a healthier option, simply look for the food with the most stars.
6. **Don't rely solely on Health Star Ratings**: While a high rating is a good indicator of a healthier choice, it's still important to check the nutrition label and ingredient list to get a complete picture of the food's nutritional value.
7. **Look for foods with higher ratings within a category**: If you're choosing between two similar foods, aim for the one with the higher Health Star Rating.

By understanding how Health Star Ratings work, shoppers can make more informed choices and pick healthier options when comparing packaged foods.","Health Star Ratings (HSR) are a front-of-pack food labeling system used in Australia and New Zealand to help consumers compare the nutritional value of packaged foods. Here's what a shopper should know:

**What are Health Star Ratings?**

Health Star Ratings are a star rating system from 0.5 to 5 stars, with 5 stars being the highest rating. The rating is based on the nutritional content of a food product, taking into account factors such as:

* Energy
* Saturated fat
* Sodium
* Total sugars
* Total carbohydrates

**How do Health Star Ratings work?**

The rating is calculated by assigning a score to each of the above factors and then adding them up. The final score is then converted to a star rating.

* 0.5 stars: Products with high levels of unhealthy ingredients (e.g., foods high in added sugars, salt, and saturated fats).
* 1-2 stars: Products with moderate levels of unhealthy ingredients.
* 3-4 stars: Products with balanced ingredients and relatively low levels of unhealthy ingredients.
* 5 stars: Products with very low levels of unhealthy ingredients and high levels of healthy ingredients (e.g., nutrient-dense foods).

**Key points to keep in mind:**

1. **Comparison not perfection**: HSR is not a ranking system, but rather a way to compare the nutritional value of different products.
2. **Not a guarantee**: A product with a higher star rating is not necessarily ""healthy."" It's still essential to check the ingredients, nutritional information, and serving sizes.
3. **Variety matters**: Even healthy products can vary in their nutritional content, so choose products with a mix of ingredients.
4. **Portions matter too**: Pay attention to serving sizes and control your portions to maintain a healthy diet.
5. **Not all products are rated**: Some products, like fresh fruits and vegetables, do not require a HSR.
6. **Manufacturer flexibility**: Manufacturers can choose which products to rate and how they are rated.

**In conclusion:** While Health Star Ratings provide a useful tool for comparing packaged foods, it's essential to remember that no labeling system can guarantee the nutritional quality of a product. Always read labels carefully, consider the ingredients and serving sizes, and choose a variety of whole foods to maintain a balanced diet.",base,5,4,5,5,5,3,5,5,"Candidate A provides more detailed and accurate information about Health Star Ratings, with explicit support from the provided texts.",base,rag

The Aged Care Quality Standards, which came into effect in July 2019, outline 8 quality standards that service providers must meet to ensure quality care for older Australians. Inspections and reporting related to food spending might focus on verifying compliance with standards 1, 2, 3, and 5, which relate to the following aspects:

- Quality of Life (Standard 1), ensuring residents' preferences and needs are met when selecting and receiving food;
- Services that Support Ongoing Care (Standard 2), checking that the aged care service provides nutritious and hygienic food and that residents' dietary needs are catered to;
- Hierarchy of Needs - Safe, High-Quality Care and Services (Standard 3), focusing on ensuring that residents receive safe and nutritious food;
- Feedback, Complaints, and Complaint Handling (Standard 5), reporting any food-related complaints or issues and ensuring the service provider addresses and resolves these concerns.

The inspections and reporting related to food spending would likely involve verifying that the aged care service:

- Provides transparent information about food costs and expenditure;
- Manages food budgeting and purchasing effectively, prioritizing quality and nutritional requirements over cost;
- Has adequate systems for food safety, storage, and handling to ensure resident nutrition and health needs are met;
- Provides personalized menus and nutrition plans tailored to residents' dietary needs and preferences.

The overall aim is to ensure that aged care residents receive healthy, safe, and nutritious food that meets their individual needs and promotes overall well-being and quality of life.","Under the Aged Care Quality Standards, reporting and inspections regarding food spending is part of Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission's requirements for quality, safety and regulation.

Aged care services must report and demonstrate their capacity to spend money on food in the following ways:

1. Aged Care Quality Standards 9: Governance, particularly for the ""Financial viability"" subsection (9.1): In part, this means being able to spend money for residents in areas including nutrition.

2. A Standard (Quality of Life) for residents that includes providing adequate food and nutrition as outlined in standard 1: ""Outcome 1"".

The purpose of inspections and reporting in relation to food spending is to assess whether an aged care provider is meeting these requirements, including providing:

1. Adequate and nutritious food options
2. A safe and inclusive dining environment
3. The capacity to accommodate individual dietary needs
4. Transparent and fair policies for food provision, and how the funds are being spent.
5. Evidence that the funds allocated to food provisions are being utilised effectively.

In Australia, the Department of Health has a responsibility for regulating and monitoring the aged care sector, including food and nutrition services. In recent years, the department has published guidelines and regulations that providers must follow to ensure residents receive high-quality care, including adequate nutrition.

For providers in Australia, some recent guidance related to food and nutrition may include:
